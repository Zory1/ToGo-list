# ToGo-list
## Essential Todos 

*Knockout.js Todos*
- [x] Skill up on Knockout.js a bit, as I had not worked with it before.
- [ ]  Piece together SPA with inline templates. 
- [ ]  Consider moving templates from inline to external files. Refactor code. 

*DB Todos*
- [ ]  Use LocalStorage to imitate db  until rest of the application is completed.
- [ ]  Refactor code to use Mongodb, if still relevant. 

*CSS Todos*
- [ ]  Use Materializecss until app functionality is done (designing layouts is not my cup of tea, using framework will save time on getting 'look & feel').
- [ ]  Refactor css to use BEM syntax, as that's what team uses. I also am curious to try it out, as I had not worked with it before.

*Documentation Todos*
- [ ]  Review inline comments through out the code.
- [ ]  Update readme.
